7. On the **Review results** pane, you should see a message that states, "**There are no feature parity issues with your server instance.**"

    ![The Review results step is shown with the 'There are no feature parity issues with your server instance' message shown.](/Hands-on%20lab/images/ms-data-migration-assistant-assessment-no-feature-parity-issues.png "Data Migration Assistant showing there are no feature parity issues")

8. On the top left of the **Review results** pane, select **Compatibility issues**.

    ![The Review results pane is shown with Compatibility issues selected and showing the 'There are no compatibility issues with your database' message shown.](/Hands-on%20lab/images/ms-data-migration-assistant-assessment-no-compatibility-issues.png "Data Migration Assistant showing there are no compatibility issues")

10. The Data Migration Assessment is complete. If there were feature parity or compatibility issues found, then you would need to address those before migrating the SQL Server database to Azure SQL MI.
