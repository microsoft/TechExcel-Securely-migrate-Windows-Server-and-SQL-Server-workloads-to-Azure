## Lab Scenario

In this exercise, you will Azure Arc-enable a Windows Server VM that Tailspin has on-premises. This VM is being Arc-enabled since there are no plans to migrate it to Azure, but Tailspin would like to simplify the management of all their VMs in a single place. Azure Arc provides the functionality to manage Azure and on-premises VMs in a single place giving Tailspin Toys exactly what they are looking for to simplify VM management and administration.
